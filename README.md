# Time-Tracker

This is a time-tracking app built with Vue.js. The time is saved in local storage, and the counter runs in the background. You
can create and delete times for your current projects, and a special animation is implemented. One of the challenges was the scrolling animation,
which was initially jerky, and not smooth. This has been fixed, and the interactivity is more fluid now.

***Currently, this does not work as expected with mobile browsers, since Javascript processes are automatically stopped when the user leaves the page.
